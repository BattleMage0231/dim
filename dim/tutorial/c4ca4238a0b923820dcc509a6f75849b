In this tutorial series, you will learn basic commands and the structure of the editor.

Moving Around

Use your arrow keys to move your caret.

Accessing these Tutorials

To access these tutorial resources, simply call the editor with the -t or --tutorial flag.
You also need to include the id of the tutorial, a positive integer.

For example, you may access them as follows:
python src/dim.py --tutorial 1
src/dim.exe -t 3

Quitting the Editor

To quit the editor from Command mode (the default mode), simply press your escape key.
Remembering how to quit the editor seems to be an extremely difficult task.
Because of this, there will be a footnote in every tutorial reminding you how to quit the editor.
