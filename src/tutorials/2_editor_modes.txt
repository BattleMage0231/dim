EDITOR MODES

Like Vim, Dim has different editor modes that can be used to do different things.

One of these modes is Command, which you are in by default. In this mode, you can input and run commands.

Another mode is Insert, where you can edit text.

A third mode is Select, where you can select and manipulate a group of text.

COMMAND MODE

In Command mode, the user can issue a series of commands that are executed.

They may not, however, edit the text directly.

To issue commands, simply type from the keyboard and press enter/return when done to execute.

INSERT MODE

In Insert mode, the user can edit text directly by typing. 

They can also remove and split text by using backspace and enter/return.

To switch to Insert mode from Command and Select mode, execute the command ```i```.

To switch to Command mode from Insert mode, simply press escape.

SELECT MODE

In Select mode, the user can select and manipulate a group of text.

They can select text by using the arrow keys. They can not edit the text directly.

Issuing commands is the same as Command mode.

To switch to Select mode from Command mode, execute the command ```v```.

Many Select mode commands work the exact same way as Command mode commands.

To switch to Command mode from Select mode, simply press escape.

QUITTING

Press escape in Command mode to quit the editor.
