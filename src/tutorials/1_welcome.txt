WELCOME TO DIM!

In this tutorial series, you will learn basic commands and the structure of the editor.

HOW TO MOVE

Use your arrow keys to move your caret.

ACCESSING THESE RESOURCES

To access these tutorial resources, simply call the editor with the -t or --tutorial flag with the index of the file you want to access as an argument.

For example, you may access them as follows:

python src/dim.py --tutorial 1
src/dim.exe -t 3

QUITTING THE EDITOR

To quit the editor from Command mode (the default mode), simply press your escape key.

Because remembering how to quit the editor seems to be an extremely difficult task for many people, there will be a footnote in every tutorial reminding you how to quit the editor.
